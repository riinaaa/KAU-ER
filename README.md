# KAU Emergency Room Queuing System

### **What is it?**	
Is an ER queuing system that estimates the waiting time for patients based on their urgency.
The patients are divided into five categories of urgency: Resuscitation, Emergent, Urgent, Less urgent and
Non-urgent.
The system will estimate the waiting time according to the information entered by the
nurses, then doctors will check the patientâ€™s priority to estimate the waiting time for the patient.
After
that the system will send a message to the patient to inform them about their queue number and the
estimated waiting time.

### **Who will use it?**	
KAU ER Queuing System will be used by Nurses and Doctors to help ER Patients save their time and keep them safe.

### **Why do they need it?**	
Due to the current Covid-19 situation the ER has always been crowded with patients which causes
more outbreaks. Also patients can spend hours waiting for a doctor to see them where they can save
their time.
